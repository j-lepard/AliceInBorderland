# AliceInBorderland
 a very simple text game - thats not completed. 

## Installation
- Windows only (sorry!)
- compile with mingw or alternative
- run the compiled (.exe) in Terminal.

## Things that work: 
- move from room to room
- take/drop items
- room timers
- game loop and attempt counter

## Thing you cannot do yet: 
- other actions - like open/use/
- interact with other characters (ie talk)
- a "win" flag or loop.
